    <h1>INTRODUCTION TO HTML</h1>
    <h2>History of HTML</h2>
    <p>The Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. HTML was created by Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991 but was not officially released. HTML was developed specifically to support linking among online resources. It was published in 1995 as HTML 2.0. HTML 4.01 was published in late 1999 and was a major version of HTML. It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript. The latest version of HTML is HTML5.

<h3>Basic Structure of HTML</h3>
<h4>List of basic HTML tags</h4>
<h5>Double Ended Tag</h5>

<ul>
   
   <li>html : This element wraps all the content on the entire page and is sometimes known as the root element.</li>
   <li>head : This element acts as a container for all the stuff you want to include on the HTML page that isn't the content you are showing to your page's viewers.</li>
   <li>body : This contains all the content that you want to show to web users when they visit your page, whether that's text, images, videos etc.</li>
   <li>h : Heading elements allow you to specify that certain parts of your content are headings â€” or subheadings. Headings (levels 1-6, i.e. H3 is a subheading within a H2 subheading). H1, H2,... tags are used to create titles</li>
   <li>p : The paragraph tag, or the p tag, is used when you want to keep a paragraph of text together. This element is a block-level element, meaning it takes up the width of its parent container.</li>
   <li>strong : Text is emphasised strongly - usually appears in bold, most of the time it looks like bold too. But it has an additional meaning, that this text should be emphasised.</li>
   <li>em : The em tag stands for emphasis. In this case, the idea of emphasizing any text will make the text look italic or slanted.</li>
   <li>ol : Ordered list. Includes List Items, which will be numbered automatically.This is very useful if you add more list items, because the numbers will always be in the right order.</li>
   <li>ul : An unordered list just means that it will have bullets for each item in the list. List items will have bullets for each item.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Self Closing Tag</h5>
<ul>
    <li>img : The IMG tag to display images on our page. The images can be within files for your web page or anywhere online. Here the most important attribute is src (source), which tells where the picture is located.</li>
    <li>a : The anchor tag, is a popular tag because it creates links to other pages on a website, and it can create links to outside websites. The one additional attribute we will mention is a href.</li>
    <li>br : The BR tag standing for a break. There are a few tags that don't need a closing tag. It's neither block and inline element. It is a global attribute.</li>
    <li>hr : The hr tag also does not need a closing tag to complete it. The hr tag, which stands for the horizontal rule, will create a line on the web page.</li>


</ul>
